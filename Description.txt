Gayatin Dental Clinic Online Reservation, Patient Profiling, Billing and Report Generation System.

The client wanted a system to replace all of it's manaul processes to make their work flow much more effecient and less time consuming. So we as team composed of three people proposed a system with 3 major functionality.

Online Reservation:
-A clinic calendar where patients could select a specific time slot and date for an appointment. Patients could only select dates and schedules that are still open or available or if the clinic is not closed on that day.

-A patient may also be able to transfer or move into another time slot or date if that date and timeslot is not yet taken or closed.

-After successfully scheduling an appointment an SMS containing the conformation code is sent to the patient's email address and phone (this may only work in the philippines), the patient must have a mobile device or an email address to be able to schedule an appointment.

-After successfully conforming the appointment the selected date and timeslot will be closed, and the patient's scheduled appointment would be pending until the time he/she is served.

-The patient may also cancel his appointment.
